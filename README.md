Write a program that can be used by a ski resort to keep track of local snow conditions for one week.   It should have a seven-element array of structure objects, where each element contains a date and the snow depth in inches at the base for that date.  
The program should have the user input the name of the month and the starting date of the seven-day period being measured.  It should then collect the data for the seven days from the user. The program should then sort the data in ascending order by base depth and display the results.
